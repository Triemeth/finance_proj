SPDR State Street Global Advisors Commodities Focused 100.21B 2004-11-18 Trailing returns as of 6/2/2025. Category is Commodities Focused. Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients but also with the global investment community. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead. Freeport-McMoRan owns stakes in 10 copper mines, led by its 49% ownership of the Grasberg copper and gold operations in Indonesia, 55% of the Cerro Verde mine in Peru, and 72% of Morenci in Arizona. It sold around 1.2 million metric tons of copper (its share) in 2024, making it the one of the world\u2019s largest copper miners by volume. It also sold about 900,000 ounces of gold, mostly from Grasberg, and 70 million pounds of molybdenum. It had about 25 years of copper reserves at the end of December 2024. We expect it to sell similar amounts of copper midcycle in 2029, though we expect gold volumes to decline to about 700,000 ounces then due to falling production at Grasberg. Based in Toronto, Barrick Gold is one of the world's largest gold miners. In 2024, the firm produced nearly 3.9 million attributable ounces of gold and about 430 million pounds of copper. At year-end 2024, Barrick had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant copper reserves. After buying Randgold in 2019 and combining its Nevada mines in a joint venture with competitor Newmont later that year, it operates mines in 19 countries in the Americas, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. The company also has growing copper exposure. Its potential Reko Diq project in Pakistan, if developed, could double copper production by the end of the decade. Newmont is the world's largest gold miner. It bought Goldcorp in 2019, combined its Nevada mines in a joint venture with competitor Barrick later that year, and also purchased competitor Newcrest in November 2023. Its portfolio includes 17 wholly or majority owned mines and interests in two joint ventures in the Americas, Africa, Australia and Papua New Guinea. The company is expected to sell roughly 5.6 million ounces of gold in 2025 from its core mines after selling six higher-cost, smaller mines. Newmont also produces material amounts of copper, silver, zinc, and lead as byproducts. It had about two decades of gold reserves along with significant byproduct reserves at the end of December 2024."

Not only does he have job security, but he also gets generous vacation time, health insurance and a pension. His friends and family think he\u2019s got it made. But every morning, Joe dreads going to work. He doesn\u2019t get along with his overbearing manager, and the work environment has turned toxic. On top of that, he\u2019s bored. The job is repetitive, and there\u2019s no room to grow within the department. Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement \u2014 what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 5 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Nervous about the stock market in 2025?

He can\u2019t imagine staying in a job he hates for three more decades \u2014 but he also wonders if the money and benefits are too good to walk away from. Joe isn\u2019t alone. Worker engagement hit an 11-year low in early 2024, with only 30% of full- and part-time American employees saying they felt highly engaged at work, according to Gallup\u2019s long-running workplace poll. So why do they stay? One reason is golden handcuffs \u2014 benefits or incentives that make it financially attractive to stick around. That includes pensions, bonuses, stock options and even company cars. Often, you have to stay with an employer for a certain period before you\u2019re eligible for those benefits, which can make some employees feel trapped, especially when they\u2019re already unhappy. Here are a few tips to help you financially plan an exit from a high-paying but soul-draining job. Start by calculating your bare-bones budget \u2014 the minimum you need to cover essential expenses like housing, utilities, bills, insurance, transportation, healthcare and groceries. Don\u2019t forget minimum debt payments and regular savings, such as contributions to retirement. Once you add it all up, you\u2019ll have your survival number \u2014 the amount you need to earn to meet basic living expenses. That number could help Joe figure out whether a low-paying but more fulfilling job could support his lifestyle. With your survival number in hand, you can take a hard look at your current spending. That means combing through your bank and credit card statements, digital transactions and savings activity."
