It has approximately 1500 employees. BHF shares are a component of the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index. Watching Weekly Claims Wall Street's focus flips back to inflation this week, as key consumer and producer inflation data is due out. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%, the S&P 500 rose 2.2%, and the Nasdaq popped 1.5%. So far this year, the Dow is up 0.5%, the S&P 2%, and the Nasdaq 1%. Earnings report this week include GameStop, J.M. Smucker, and Dave & Buster's on Tuesday; Oracle and Chewy on Wednesday; and Adobe on Thursday. The final scoreboard for 1Q showed earnings growth of 14%, this after 17% growth in 4Q24 and 9% in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For 1Q, Healthcare was the leading sector, up 46%, while Energy was at the bottom, down 17%. On the economic calendar, Wednesday features the Consumer Price Index, Thursday the Producer Price Index, and Friday an update on Consumer Sentiment. We have adjusted our S&P 500 EPS estimates. For 2025, our forecast for S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations is now $270, reduced from $276. For 2026, our new estimate is $300, reduced from $307. Our new 2025 EPS estimate implies full-year EPS growth of 10%, reduced from 12%. And our new 2026 estimate assumes EPS growth of 10%, reduced from 11%. Meanwhile, the Economic Call of the Week from Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is the report on Initial Jobless Claims, on which he offered the following. 'Last week's print of 247,000 claims for the week ended May 31 is a wake-up call -- but not a fire alarm. Recent data shows a job market that is solid but slowing. The Unemployment Rate is low and steady at 4.2%. Payrolls rose by a solid 139,000 in May, but growth in March and April was revised lower by a notable 95,000. Is this revision and the increase in unemployment claims an inflection point for the economy? Weekly Jobless Claims, which are regarded as a leading economic indicator, can help make an assessment. Next week's four-week moving average of new filings for unemployment insurance will almost certainly remain below the level of 300,000, the level that raises our fears of a recession. But with nearly 285,000 job cuts announced by the federal government this year and only 59,000 appearing in the monthly employment reports through May, we will take a close look at our forecasts if the four-week average stays above 250,000 for several weeks. Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast is at 3.8% for 2Q. That follows the decline of 0.3% for 1Q. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast calls for a 2.7% rate for CPI in June, which is higher than the May rate. Mortgage rates inched lower last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.85%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down three cents to an average of $3.13 per gallon for regular gas. Looking ahead, the next Fed rate decision is on June 18, with odds at 3% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. The next meeting after that is on July 30, and odds for a rate cut have fallen to 16%. Brighthouse Financial provides life insurance and annuity products in the U.S. The company was spun off from MetLife in August 2017. It has approximately 1500 employees. BHF shares are a component of the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index. The major stock indices are all higher at midday on Friday, although higher stock prices at midday have not been a guarantee of higher stock prices at the close of late (or ever). Overall, there is still a lot of pressure on equities and the technical condition of the overall stock market is weakening. On the positive side, an imminent shutdown of the U.S. government seem less likely than more likely. On the negative side, consumer sentiment plunged in March and inflation expectations increased. Specifically, the University of Michigan sentiment survey fell to 57.9 from 64.7 last month, while worries about tariffs and trade wars are leading to growing expectations that overall prices are on track to rise."

Plus, the account comes with a complimentary ATM card and free transfers between direct deposit accounts. Read our full review of UFB Direct By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy The amount of interest you can earn with a rate of 4% depends on how much money you deposit. The more money you keep in your account, and the longer you hold it there, the more you stand to earn thanks to compound interest. For example, if you deposited $1,000 into a 4% interest savings account that compounds interest daily and left the money there for one year, you'd earn a total of $40 in interest (assuming you don't make any additional contributions). Let's say you deposited $10,000. At the end of the year, you'd earn $400 in interest. And if you made an additional $100 contribution each month, you'd end up with $421.84 in interest earnings. Finding a savings account that pays 4% on your balance is a great way to give your savings a boost and help it grow over time. However, there are additional steps you can take to get the most value out of your account. Start with a higher principal balance: The more money you deposit initially, the more interest you earn from the start. Contribute regularly: Consider setting up automatic transfers to the savings account. Even small, consistent deposits can make a big difference over time. If you contribute $100 monthly \u2014 that\u2019s an extra $1,200 per year that earns 4% interest, which compounds to grow even more. Take advantage of compound interest: Make sure the interest on your account compounds at least monthly, if not daily. The more frequently interest is compounded, the more your money will grow. Keep your money in the account: Each time you withdraw funds from your savings account, the principal balance that earns interest decreases, which reduces the overall growth potential. A checking account or money market account may be a better fit for money you need for daily spending or paying bills. Watch out for fees: Look for a savings account with no monthly maintenance fees or other charges that could eat into your interest. Some high-yield accounts have minimum balance requirements to avoid fees or earn the highest advertised rate, so be sure you can meet those minimums \u2014 or choose an account with no minimum balance requirement. See our picks for the 10 best high-yield savings accounts Savings accounts that offer 4% are becoming increasingly hard to find. Recent rate cuts by the Federal Reserve signal that the economy is moving in the right direction, but they also mean deposit account rates are on the decline. Additional rate cuts could be on the horizon, so it pays to take advantage of an account with a higher rate while it lasts. For those looking to maximize their savings, it might be wise to take advantage of current rates while they remain elevated. If you want to lock in today's higher rates, you may want to consider a certificate of deposit (CD) instead of a high-yield savings account. A bank account's interest rate is how much it earns in one year, while APY represents your total annual interest with compounding factored in. Read on to learn more about APY vs. interest rate. CD interest rates play a key role in how much your savings can grow. Find out where today\u2019s average CD rates stand and how to maximize your interest earnings.

But with nearly 285,000 job cuts announced by the federal government this year and only 59,000 appearing in the monthly employment reports through May, we will take a close look at our forecasts if the four-week average stays above 250,000 for several weeks. Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast is at 3.8% for 2Q. That follows the decline of 0.3% for 1Q. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast calls for a 2.7% rate for CPI in June, which is higher than the May rate. Mortgage rates inched lower last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.85%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down three cents to an average of $3.13 per gallon for regular gas. Looking ahead, the next Fed rate decision is on June 18, with odds at 3% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. The next meeting after that is on July 30, and odds for a rate cut have fallen to 16%.

That would be the \"Summer Doldrums,\" which in our view starts around Independence Day and lasts until Labor Day. Trading volume slows and the months of July and August on occasion can be volatile, with a share of downside action. The recent metals market has been nothing short of confusing, and our call for some decent downside, especially in gold, has not been on the mark. GLD peaked at an intraday high of $317.63 on April 22 after a nine-day parabolic move. That spike occurred after a very strong rally that started early this year. The beginning of the overall current uptrend started back in early 2024, with GLD in the $190 area. The metal had been in a multi-year base that started in August 2020, so there was a lot of pent-up demand that had to be released. The reason for the major breakout and huge rally is still unknown, as it has corresponded with a very choppy U.S. Dollar Index. Generally, gold and silver respond well to a weak greenback, and vice versa. So far, GLD dropped to an intraday low of $291.78 on May 16, which just happened to be the location of the rising 50-day average. It's possible that GLD has been tracing out a bull flag since its peak, working off extreme overbought momentum. Unless the recent low gets taken out with conviction, the likelihood of another run higher is strong. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) Director of Research Jim Kelleher, CFA, has surveyed the Argus analyst team about the impact of tariffs on companies in the Argus Universe of Coverage. The tariff environment is dynamic, to say the least. The White House has levied tariffs or threatened to levy tariffs, but often paused, postponed, or withdrawn pledged tariffs. Most recently, China and the U.S. agreed to reduce baseline tariffs to 10% for 90 days (30% in the U.S. reflecting a 20% fentanyl penalty). More than the tariffs themselves, the lack of a finished tariff infrastructure complicates business planning, staffing decisions, and capital investment. Within this dynamic environment, companies are focused on taking actions in areas they can control and planning proactively for a range of tariff scenarios. Companies are anticipating both direct and indirect tariff impacts. Direct impacts would include higher costs for imported finished goods and components, foregone sales as a result of reciprocal tariffs in other nations, and other factors. For example, a manufacturing company would face direct impacts as it pays higher prices for imported parts. Indirect impacts would include a slowing in business related to a broad softening in the economy. All companies likely will feel indirect impacts. A utility, for example, could begin to see a slowing in industrial and commercial kilowatt-hour sales, particularly in niches such as warehousing, trucking and rail, and other freight-related functions. We asked Argus analysts to survey their companies for their commentary on direct and indirect tariff impacts, as well as actions these companies are taking to mitigate the challenging trade environment. Nearly every company in Argus analyst coverage has issued commentary regarding tariffs, much as (five years ago) nearly every company in coverage had something to say about the then-developing COVID-19 pandemic. Below we offer a sampling of company responses to the unfolding tariff environment across a range of sectors and industries. We intend to update our survey on a regular basis at least until the tariff environment, in whatever shape or form, becomes a stable part of the U.S. economy. We are raising our intermediate-term technical outlook back to bullish from neutral. The major indices all traced out bullish ABC reversal patterns from April 8 until April 22 and have taken on the look of a \"V\" bottom. After the massive gains on Monday, when the S&P 500 (SPX) soared 3.1%, the Nasdaq rocketed 4.2%, and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) surged 3.9%, the three indices broke convincingly above their flat 200-day and 50-week averages for the first time since losing these key supports in early March. As well, the indices all broke well above the key 61.8% retracement of their correction/bear markets. They also completed large and compact bullish inverse head-and-shoulders formations. This all suggests a run at least back to the earlier all-time highs, and possibly higher. Some of the key intermediate-term signals that have turned bullish -- and that we have discussed recently -- include a number of breadth thrusts usually seen at key market bottoms; an absolute destruction in market sentiment in March and April; a buy signal from the weekly Bollinger Band (BB) chart, as the SPX lost, then recovered, the lower BB; very large monthly bullish candlesticks for the major indices; and new all-time highs for the major advance/decline lines. The SPX completed a 950-point reversal and, based on its size, we estimate a minimum measured move to the 6,450-6,740 region, or 11%-15% higher than Monday's close. For the QQQ (507), we project a minimum advance to 557-585, or a 10%-15% move. The next obstacle is the all-time highs of 6,144 for the SPX and 539 for the QQQ. (Mark Arbeter, CMT) This pick list highlights constituents of the Morningstar US Large Cap Index that we believe offer investors the best risk-adjusted return prospects. Stocks of large-cap companies where neither growth nor value characteristics predominate. Stocks in the top 70% of the capitalization of the U.S. equity market are defined as large cap."

Watching Weekly Claims Wall Street's focus flips back to inflation this week, as key consumer and producer inflation data is due out. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%, the S&P 500 rose 2.2%, and the Nasdaq popped 1.5%. So far this year, the Dow is up 0.5%, the S&P 2%, and the Nasdaq 1%. Earnings report this week include GameStop, J.M. Smucker, and Dave & Buster's on Tuesday; Oracle and Chewy on Wednesday; and Adobe on Thursday. The final scoreboard for 1Q showed earnings growth of 14%, this after 17% growth in 4Q24 and 9% in 3Q24, according to LSEG. For 1Q, Healthcare was the leading sector, up 46%, while Energy was at the bottom, down 17%. On the economic calendar, Wednesday features the Consumer Price Index, Thursday the Producer Price Index, and Friday an update on Consumer Sentiment. We have adjusted our S&P 500 EPS estimates. For 2025, our forecast for S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations is now $270, reduced from $276. For 2026, our new estimate is $300, reduced from $307. Our new 2025 EPS estimate implies full-year EPS growth of 10%, reduced from 12%. And our new 2026 estimate assumes EPS growth of 10%, reduced from 11%. Meanwhile, the Economic Call of the Week from Argus Chief Economist Chris Graja, CFA, is the report on Initial Jobless Claims, on which he offered the following. 'Last week's print of 247,000 claims for the week ended May 31 is a wake-up call -- but not a fire alarm. Recent data shows a job market that is solid but slowing. The Unemployment Rate is low and steady at 4.2%. Payrolls rose by a solid 139,000 in May, but growth in March and April was revised lower by a notable 95,000. Is this revision and the increase in unemployment claims an inflection point for the economy? Weekly Jobless Claims, which are regarded as a leading economic indicator, can help make an assessment.

    "text": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below. Soaring food prices have been hurting consumers for years. But things are coming to a head, especially as retailers and consumers grapple with tariff concerns. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently shared at the Economic Club of Chicago that food prices are still elevated \u2014 and that consumers are showing signs of \"stress behaviors.\" Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has an important message for the next wave of American retirees \u2014 here's how he says you can best weather the US retirement crisis Nervous about the stock market in 2025? Find out how you can access this $1B private real estate fund (with as little as $10) \u201cWe worry about that,\u201d McMillon said. \u201cYou can see that the money runs out before the month is gone.\u201d McMillon says that shoppers are being more selective in what they buy and are prioritizing value purchases. \u201cThere are lots of income levels in this country \u2014 if you\u2019re at the lower end of that scale, you are feeling more frustration and pain because of higher food prices,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve persisted for years now, and you\u2019re just tired of it.\" But what\u2019s the ripple effect behind these price increases? Food prices away from home were up 3.9% broadly year over year in April, while food prices at home were up 2% annually, according to the Consumer Price Index. All told, food prices have shot up nearly 25% since 2020. A big reason for the spike is the supply chain issues caused by severe weather and global events. It hasn't helped that several food staples have been in short supply. In late 2024, a survey by Swiftly found that 70% of American consumers are having difficulty affording groceries. The broader immigration crackdown could also negatively affect food costs, as it might lead to labor shortages that impact supply. With the potential return of tariffs to drive prices up even more, things could get worse before they get better. Unfortunately, consumers may be in for another year of soaring grocery prices. But there are steps you can take to reduce the burden. Planning your week based on what's on sale at your local supermarket is a good idea. Focus on meals that freeze easily \u2014 like casseroles and stews. This way, you can whip up a lot of food and have leftovers. Make sure you're signed up for your supermarket's loyalty program. You may qualify for extra discounts, promotions or digital coupons that save you even more."

The tariff environment is dynamic, to say the least. The White House has levied tariffs or threatened to levy tariffs, but often paused, postponed, or withdrawn pledged tariffs. Most recently, China and the U.S. agreed to reduce baseline tariffs to 10% for 90 days (30% in the U.S. reflecting a 20% fentanyl penalty). More than the tariffs themselves, the lack of a finished tariff infrastructure complicates business planning, staffing decisions, and capital investment. Within this dynamic environment, companies are focused on taking actions in areas they can control and planning proactively for a range of tariff scenarios. Companies are anticipating both direct and indirect tariff impacts. Direct impacts would include higher costs for imported finished goods and components, foregone sales as a result of reciprocal tariffs in other nations, and other factors. For example, a manufacturing company would face direct impacts as it pays higher prices for imported parts. Indirect impacts would include a slowing in business related to a broad softening in the economy. All companies likely will feel indirect impacts. A utility, for example, could begin to see a slowing in industrial and commercial kilowatt-hour sales, particularly in niches such as warehousing, trucking and rail, and other freight-related functions. We asked Argus analysts to survey their companies for their commentary on direct and indirect tariff impacts, as well as actions these companies are taking to mitigate the challenging trade environment. Nearly every company in Argus analyst coverage has issued commentary regarding tariffs, much as (five years ago) nearly every company in coverage had something to say about the then-developing COVID-19 pandemic. Below we offer a sampling of company responses to the unfolding tariff environment across a range of sectors and industries. We intend to update our survey on a regular basis at least until the tariff environment, in whatever shape or form, becomes a stable part of the U.S. economy. Intuitive Surgical develops, produces, and markets a robotic system for assisting minimally invasive surgery. It also provides the instrumentation, disposable accessories, and warranty services for the system. The company has placed more than 9,500 da Vinci systems in hospitals worldwide, with more than 5,500 installations in the US and a growing number in emerging markets. Intuitive Surgical designs, manufactures, and markets da Vinci robotic surgical systems and related instruments and accessories in the U.S. and internationally. The da Vinci system enables surgeons to perform a wide range of surgical procedures with shorter recovery periods and higher patient comfort. ISRG was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. Stocks are lower at midday on signs that the U.S. economy is slowing faster than expected. For 1Q, consumers and businesses scooped up imports tilting the trade balance and lowering GDP. We got a big hint that this was coming in the Trade Deficit in Goods numbers out yesterday proving the rush to buy imports before expected price increases due to tariffs. The advance estimate for GDP showed a decline of 0.3%, the first contraction in 3 years. Key inflation data out this morning shows the pace of inflation is slowing. Headline PCE slowed to 2.3% in March versus 2.7% the month before. Core PCE decelerated to 2.6% compared to 3.0%. On a month-by-month basis, both measures came in at 0.0% changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is 4.16%. Oil is at $60 per barrel."

Toll Brothers is a leading builder of upscale homes, serving step-up, empty-nest, active-adult, and second-home buyers. The company delivered 10,813 homes in FY24. At the end of the fiscal year, the company operated 408 selling communities across 24 states. The company operates its own lumber distribution, component-assembly, and manufacturing operations. Toll also has subsidiaries that provide architectural, engineering, mortgage, title land development and golf course management services. TOL also operates a growing number of for-rent apartments. The company, which is based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, had fiscal FY23 home sales of $10.6 billion, up from $9.9 billion in FY23 and the pre-pandemic record of $7.08 billion in FY19. In April 2022, TOL was the number 4 U.S. homebuilder based on revenue. The company's fiscal year ends on October 31. Stock are mostly hanging on to gains at midday, this after futures initially were solidly higher but then fell on news from ADP that private payrolls grew by just 37,000 in May. That was fewer than the 114,000 expected and below the 60,000 added in April. The result was the smallest increase in private payrolls since March 2023, with the financial press generally blaming uncertainty over trade wars and tariffs. ADP's chief economist noted the following. 'After a strong start to the year, hiring is losing momentum. Pay growth, however, was little changed in May, holding at robust levels for both job-stayers and job-changers.' The weak reading sets up for an even more closely-watched nonfarm payrolls report by the government on Friday. Toll Brothers is the leading luxury homebuilder in the United States with an average sale price well above public competitors'. The company operates in over 60 markets across 24 states and caters to move-up, active-adult, and second-homebuyers. Traditional homebuilding operations represent most of company\u2019s revenue. Toll Brothers also builds luxury for-sale and for-rent properties in urban centers across the US. It has its headquarters in Horsham, Pennsylvania."

The cryptocurrency landscape has witnessed a significant shift as corporations increasingly adopt bitcoin as a treasury asset. While this trend has contributed to bitcoin\u2019s recent price surge, it may also be creating new vulnerabilities in the market that warrant careful consideration. Corporate adoption of bitcoin has accelerated notably, with companies following the playbook pioneered by MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR). According to Bitcoin Treasuries data, 110 publicly listed companies globally now hold bitcoin, representing a substantial institutional commitment to the digital asset.

Grow your IRA or 401(k) with Crypto \u2013 unlock  the power of alternative investments including a Crypto IRA within your retirement account. Standard Chartered\u2019s analysis focuses on a refined sample of 61 companies that purchase bitcoin purely as a treasury holding, excluding industry participants like miners, exchanges, and service providers. This subset collectively owned nearly 674,000 bitcoins as of May\u2019s end\u2014representing 3.2% of bitcoin\u2019s total 21 million coin supply. The numbers tell a compelling story: these \u201cbitcoin treasuries\u201d have doubled their holdings over just two months, accumulating close to 100,000 additional bitcoins during this period. This buying pressure has been a key factor driving bitcoin to recent all-time highs. However, Standard Chartered\u2019s analysis reveals a concerning dynamic that could eventually reverse this supportive trend. Unlike Strategy, which accumulated bitcoin over time at various price points, many newer corporate entrants have purchased at significantly higher average prices. The bank\u2019s research suggests that approximately half of the monitored corporate treasuries would find themselves underwater if bitcoin fell below $90,000. This creates a potential domino effect where companies that entered the bitcoin treasury strategy during price peaks could become forced sellers during market downturns. The risk stems from several interconnected factors: Purchase Price Disparities: Most corporate treasuries in Standard Chartered\u2019s sample have average purchase prices well above Strategy\u2019s cost basis, making them more vulnerable to market volatility."

It is a leading pure-play energy provider with transmission and distribution operations in the U.S. and headquarters in Chicago. Exelon spun off its generation business in 2022, which was about 60% nuclear, as Constellation Energy. Constellation is now a publicly traded company (CEG) focused on generation and competitive distribution, while Exelon focuses on regulated transmission and distribution. Exelon shares were repriced as a result of this separation. As of the beginning of 2025, Exelon has about 9.2 million electric customers and 1.4 million gas customers through its six regulated utility subsidiaries. Its service regions are primarily in central Maryland (Baltimore Gas & Electric Co.), northern Illinois (ComEd), and southeastern Pennsylvania (PECO). Revenues in 2024 were about $23 billion. Of 2024 adjusted operating earnings, about 45% were from ComEd and 30% from PHI. The company aims to cut emissions by 50% by 2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Stellantis is so far cutting up to 1,600 staff in total across Italy this year through the voluntary redundancy scheme. At Mirafiori, the scheme \"is aimed at supporting early retirement or different career opportunities,\" a company spokesperson said, adding workers at Mirafiori can sign up for it until the end of July. The Mirafiori plant will have a stable workforce from August to prepare for the launch of the new hybrid version of the Fiat 500 city car, the spokesperson said. Full-scale production of the new model is expected to start in November. Luigi Paone of Uilm, one of the unions which agreed the voluntary redundancy plan with Stellantis, said it would be aimed at workers closer to retirement age. The plan \"should serve to pave the way for the hiring of young workers as we approach the production start-up of the hybrid 500,\" Paone said. Between April and May Stellantis agreed similar packages at other assembly plants in Italy, including Melfi and Pomigliano, for a total workforce reduction of up to 1,660 workers this year. The company has fewer than 40,000 staff in Italy, down from 55,000 in early 2021 when the group was created through the merger of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot maker PSA.

'Last week's print of 247,000 claims for the week ended May 31 is a wake-up call -- but not a fire alarm. Recent data shows a job market that is solid but slowing. The Unemployment Rate is low and steady at 4.2%. Payrolls rose by a solid 139,000 in May, but growth in March and April was revised lower by a notable 95,000. Is this revision and the increase in unemployment claims an inflection point for the economy? Weekly Jobless Claims, which are regarded as a leading economic indicator, can help make an assessment. Next week's four-week moving average of new filings for unemployment insurance will almost certainly remain below the level of 300,000, the level that raises our fears of a recession. But with nearly 285,000 job cuts announced by the federal government this year and only 59,000 appearing in the monthly employment reports through May, we will take a close look at our forecasts if the four-week average stays above 250,000 for several weeks. Turning to other data, the Atlanta Fed GDPNow forecast is at 3.8% for 2Q. That follows the decline of 0.3% for 1Q. The Cleveland Fed Inflation Nowcast calls for a 2.7% rate for CPI in June, which is higher than the May rate. Mortgage rates inched lower last week, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.85%, according to FreddieMac. Gas prices ticked down three cents to an average of $3.13 per gallon for regular gas. Looking ahead, the next Fed rate decision is on June 18, with odds at 3% for a rate cut, according to the CME FedWatch rate tool. The next meeting after that is on July 30, and odds for a rate cut have fallen to 16%.

That was fewer than the 114,000 expected and below the 60,000 added in April. The result was the smallest increase in private payrolls since March 2023, with the financial press generally blaming uncertainty over trade wars and tariffs. ADP's chief economist noted the following. 'After a strong start to the year, hiring is losing momentum. Pay growth, however, was little changed in May, holding at robust levels for both job-stayers and job-changers.' The weak reading sets up for an even more closely-watched nonfarm payrolls report by the government on Friday. This first-quarter earnings season has had a special tone. As usual, many companies have offered guidance. But they also have increasingly focused on the economy, tariffs, and overall uncertainty. On tariffs specifically, managements are detailing any likely impact on profits and any plans to pass price hikes on to customers and/or consumers. Our team of analysts is factoring all this fresh data into sector outlooks, earnings forecasts, and investment ratings. We track the list of companies raising guidance, and this quarter that list often features companies in sectors such as Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Often missing are companies the Financials, Energy, and Materials sectors. Companies that are still able to raise guidance despite the tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could feature managements that have flexibility in a changing environment, and that is often a catalyst for market-beating returns. Indeed, \"Management Signals\" is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The following is a list of some of the companies in our Fundamental Universe of Coverage where management recently increased guidance.

But they may be in a better position to generate market-beating returns going forward. For one thing, SMID companies tend to focus on domestic markets, so their businesses could be less disrupted by the trade and tariff debate, or fallout from unrest in the Middle East, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, issues in China, or other geopolitical developments. As well, the prices of SMID stocks generally are lower than the prices of large-caps. Finally, there are long stretches in the record books when SMID stocks have outperformed large-caps. SMID stocks can be risky, but despite those risks, diversified investors look to have exposure to small- and mid-caps based on the long-term performance record. We estimate that 20% of the U.S. stock market's capitalization is comprised of SMID stocks.

Earnings season is mostly over and so far, according to FactSet, 78% of S&P 500 (SPX) companies have beat EPS estimates and 63% beat revenue estimates. So was it too early for tariffs to take a bite? There are some big reports still to come, including arguably the biggest (Nvidia) after the close on Wednesday. Other reports come from OKTA, DKS, ANF, CRM, HPQ, SNPS, VEEV, BBY, COST, DELL, MRVL, ZS, ULTA, and NTAP, with CRWD and AVGO next week. Stock futures were nicely higher over the weekend as President Trump agreed to a deadline extension (until July 9) with the European Union over tariffs. So with last week's mild selloff, and the SPX kissing its 200-day from above for the first time since early March, it's possible that another leg higher is about to kick in. This next advancing phase could take the major indices back to their all-time highs from December 2024 (Nasdaq) and February 2025 (SPX and Nasdaq 100). A move to the prior highs or possibly to new all-time highs would set the majors up for a decent pullback and a much-needed rest. What continues to confound us (and is quite bullish) is that many professional and individual investors have dug in their heels and remain neutral or bearish. Indeed, the recent powerful move higher, the breadth thrusts, and the constructive headlines have not been enough to convert the masses. We have heard for months that stocks remain vulnerable until the tariff situation is resolved. But if you wait for a problem to be totally solved, you could very well miss a good portion of any recovery.

The major stocks indices are higher at midday on Friday, riding a jobs report this morning that matched the Argus estimate while beating the overall Street consensus. For now, it appears that hiring is still happening even with the headwind of tariff uncertainty. As well, a reported calming in the war of words between President Trump and Elon Musk reassured those who saw that brouhaha as having a possible significant negative impact on current events. Founded in 2007, MongoDB is a document-oriented database. MongoDB provides both licenses as well as subscriptions as a service for its NoSQL database.

As usual, many companies have offered guidance. But they also have increasingly focused on the economy, tariffs, and overall uncertainty. On tariffs specifically, managements are detailing any likely impact on profits and any plans to pass price hikes on to customers and/or consumers. Our team of analysts is factoring all this fresh data into sector outlooks, earnings forecasts, and investment ratings. We track the list of companies raising guidance, and this quarter that list often features companies in sectors such as Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Often missing are companies the Financials, Energy, and Materials sectors. Companies that are still able to raise guidance despite the tariff and macroeconomic uncertainty could feature managements that have flexibility in a changing environment, and that is often a catalyst for market-beating returns. Indeed, \"Management Signals\" is one of our Investment Themes for 2025. The following is a list of some of the companies in our Fundamental Universe of Coverage where management recently increased guidance. Twilio is a cloud-based communications platform-as-a-service company offering communication building blocks that allow for a fully customized customer engagement experience spanning voice, video, chat, and SMS messaging. It does this through various application programming interfaces and prebuilt solution applications aimed at improving customer engagement. The company leverages its Super Network, a global network of carrier relationships, to facilitate high-speed, cost-effective communication. Twilio provides a cloud-based communications platform that enables businesses to embed messaging, voice, video, and authentication capabilities directly into their software applications. The company's platform allows developers to build and manage applications without the complexity of creating and maintaining underlying infrastructure. It completed its initial public offering in June 2016. Many brokerage firms that serve retail and institutional clients maintain data to measure investment sentiment. This can be very valuable when evaluating how the small investor, or even the corporate giants, are feeling about the stock market - and, more importantly, what are they doing with their funds. Charles Schwab is one of those firms, with its Schwab Trading Activity Index, or STAX. STAX is a proprietary, behavior-based index designed to indicate the sentiment of retail investors and has been incorporating data since January 2019. In April, STAX fell to 41.2, down 15% from 48.4 in March and the lowest headline reading since April 2023. The STAX fell every week of the April period, though the first week saw the heaviest selling as STAX fell 11%, the biggest weekly drop since the first week of April 2023. The third week of the four saw only mild net-selling, but selling accelerated again in the final week (ended April 25). On a monthly basis, April's overall STAX plunge of 14.9% was the deepest drop since March 2020, the first full month of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is just another example of what we have been talking about for weeks, namely the similarity between 2025's correction and the pandemic correction. The current STAX reading is closing in on the low level of 37.2 at the end of 2022, right after that bear market bottomed. During the 2023/2024 market advance, the index never got out of neutral territory, peaking at 55."

The Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers is a daily report that identifies the five companies the largest insider purchase transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions as well as the five companies the largest insider sales transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions. Snowflake is a cloud-native data warehouse company. The company leverages the large public hyperscale cloud services to provide its Data Cloud to customers, enabling them to unify disparate data sources for the purposes of data engineering, and the development of artificial intelligence, applications, collaboration, and cybersecurity. Snowflake went public on September 16, 2020 at $120 per share. The company derives 23% of its revenue outside the U.S. In this commentary last week, we described the weekly insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research as being stable after multiple weeks of bullish movement. This week, the song remains very much the same. Mirroring the sentiment in the broader market of late, insiders appear to think it is unlikely that share prices will convincingly recapture all-time high territory -- but also don't seem inclined to believe another steep drop is imminent. It is hard to manage a business on 90-day mandates, and similarly hard to invest for the long-term with ongoing volatility in the news cycle. End of day, the current eight-week sentiment barometers from Vickers fall in line a follows (with any ratio below 2.00 bullish and any ratio between 2.00 and 6.00 neutral). The NYSE Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is now 2.04, neutral and slightly worse than last week; the Nasdaq Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is now 2.66, neutral and slightly better than last week; and the Total (all exchanges) Eight-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is now 2.30, neutral and flat with last week. Insider selling outpaced insider buying across all sectors over the last week, but insider buying in the Industrial sector lagged selling by a factor of just 2.7-times. Selling was the greatest in Consumer Discretionary over the last week, with shares valued at $458 million sold versus less than $2 million bought. Selling was also notable in Information Technology, with shares valued at $259 million sold versus just over $2 million bought. This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at The Middleby Corp. (NGS: MIDD) and Microsoft Corp. (NGS: MSFT)."

This initiative will not only boost productivity but also provide ZF Automotive UK's workforce with valuable opportunities to acquire new skills pertinent to advanced manufacturing processes. ZF Automotive UK Operations director Steven McKenzie said: \u201cOur team in Pontypool is passionately working to continually improve our manufacturing operations, to ensure competitiveness in a challenging automotive sector. \u201cThis funding will support our efforts to purchase equipment and tooling to secure new business, in addition to supporting our heating project to significantly improve our energy efficiency.\u201d Moreover, the investment will facilitate the creation of apprenticeship and graduate positions, further contributing to the local economy and job market. Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Energy and Planning Rebecca Evans said: \u201cZF Automotive is a well established and important employer for Pontypool and the surrounding area with many long serving staff. \"The funding will help the business decarbonise and optimise its operations, bringing highly sought after contracts with Jaguar Land Rover to Wales and upskilling staff as a result.\u201d In addition to workforce development, ZF Automotive UK plans to utilise the funds to replace its outdated gas heating system, which has been in operation for over 50 years. The upgrade is expected to enhance energy efficiency at the site, leading to a substantial reduction in carbon emissions. ZF Friedrichshafen\u2019s sales for the fiscal year 2024 declined 11% from the previous year\u2019s \u20ac46.6bn to \u20ac41.4bn. The company said the decline was primarily due to the deconsolidation of its axle assembly product line, which was transferred to the ZF Foxconn Chassis Modules joint venture in April 2024. Looking ahead to 2025, ZF Group anticipates only weak economic growth in the eurozone and Germany, with vehicle markets potentially staying below previous year levels. In February, ZF Group announced that it had commenced series production of its state-of-the-art steer-by-wire system. It eliminates the need for a mechanical connection between the steering wheel and steering gear, is being implemented in Nio Inc's flagship ET9 model, a Chinese battery electric vehicle (BEV)."

    "text": "Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the 10 tech stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar right now. On June 6, Truist analyst William Stein increased his price target on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) to $295 from $267 and maintained a Buy rating after the company posted solid results for FQ2 2025. The firm noted that the stock dipped due to limited immediate AI upside, compared to investor expectations. However, Stein believes that Broadcom\u2019s (NASDAQ:AVGO) long-term AI outlook remains strong and expects new customer gains to be a prospect for future growth. The company reported strong Q2 results, with adjusted earnings per share of $1.58 and revenue of $15 billion, which was a 20% year-over-year growth. The company posted $10 billion in adjusted EBITDA, which represented 67% of revenue, and generated $6.4 billion in free cash flow. For the third quarter, the company projects revenue around $15.8 billion and expects adjusted EBITDA to reach at least 66% of that total. A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has transitioned from a traditional semiconductor company into a core provider of AI infrastructure. Despite a pullback after earnings, AI revenue surged 46% year-over-year to $4.4 billion, supported by strong networking demand, while non-AI semiconductor and infrastructure software segments were weaker. However, strong momentum is projected into Q3. Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) develops and supplies advanced semiconductor devices and software solutions used across a wide range of technologies, including AI networking, wireless connectivity, storage systems, and industrial automation. The company\u2019s products support important functions in consumer electronics, data centers, and communication infrastructure. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients but also with the global investment community. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.

    "text": "We came across a bullish thesis on Roku, Inc. (ROKU) on The Finance Corner\u2019s Substack by Kostadin Ristovski. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on ROKU. Roku, Inc. (ROKU)'s share was trading at $74.6 as of 5th June. Close up of a hand holding a tablet device with video services streaming. Roku, much like the classic razor-and-blades model, has positioned itself as a hardware gateway to a highly monetizable software ecosystem. Initially launched in 2008 to support Netflix, Roku began with low-cost streaming devices, eventually expanding into a broad lineup of physical products\u2014from smart TVs and speakers to home accessories\u2014sold at a loss to attract users. The real value lies in the Roku OS, which it licenses freely to TV manufacturers like TCL and Hisense, enabling Roku to grow its user base without owning hardware production. This feeds into its true moneymaker: the platform business. The Roku Channel, launched in 2017, now features over 80,000 titles and more than 500 live channels, all of which are ad-supported. The company also earns by taking cuts from streaming subscriptions and charging content providers for distribution and prominence. Unlike content-heavy rivals, Roku remains content-agnostic, focusing on being the go-to aggregator and ad platform in the streaming value chain. Strategic acquisitions in data analytics, content, and ad tech have strengthened this positioning. While Roku isn't profitable yet due to the drag from its hardware division and rapid pandemic-era expansion, its platform gross margin stands at 54%, and the company holds $1.7B in net cash. International growth, ad innovation (including shoppable ads via Walmart), and potential new verticals, such as gaming, suggest that revenue can continue to grow at a rate of nearly 10% annually. Despite trading near its estimated fair value, Roku presents a compelling case due to operating leverage, potential margin expansion, and even acquisition interest. Investors face dilution risks and limited governance, but the long-term digital ad tailwinds remain highly attractive. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Roku by LongYield in May 2025, which aligns with Kostadin Ristovski\u2019s June 2025 view. The stock has since then appreciated by approximately 23%. Both highlight Roku\u2019s high-margin platform business and ad monetization strength. LongYield focuses on improving financials, guidance, and recent acquisitions, while Ristovski emphasizes Roku\u2019s razor-and-blades model, OS distribution, and long-term operating leverage. The theses reinforce each other but differ in focus\u2014one near-term execution, the other strategic positioning."

    "text": "If you\u2019re brand-new to investing, all the terminology related to the stock market can be off-putting. Instead of learning what feels like a new language, you might feel overwhelmed and hold off on investing. However, many stock market and general investing terms are much simpler than they seem at first glance. If you keep an open mind, you might be surprised how quickly you can learn the lingo and gain confidence investing. Read Next: 12 Best Safe Investments To Grow Your Money in 2025 Explore More: 8 Common Mistakes Retirees Make With Their Social Security Checks Here are some examples of stock market terms that you should know and aren\u2019t as complex as they might sound. Also see eight tips to invest in stocks for beginners. You might see headlines about stock market volatility or hear about the volatility of a particular stock, and while it might seem like something to fear, it\u2019s not necessarily something to run from. \u201cThe term volatility can often scare newer and even experienced investors because it is often associated with negative events, but the meaning itself is quite simple. Volatility means how much a stock goes up and down,\u201d said Nicole Carlon, CFP, wealth management advisor at WiseOak Wealth. And not all stocks are the same in terms of volatility. \u201cSome stocks may be more volatile than others. This means the price of the stock will go up and down more often than one that is less volatile. It does not mean that one stock is better than the other, but that the value fluctuates more. It\u2019s up to the investor how much fluctuation they feel they can handle,\u201d Carlon explained. Check Out: Suze Orman: 3 Biggest Mistakes You Can Make as an Investor Another key term to know is diversification, as it\u2019s typically an important part of managing risk. \u201cDiversification sounds to the average investor like a complicated strategy, but in layman\u2019s terms it means not putting all of your eggs in one basket,\u201d Carlon said. \u201cEssentially, an investor would buy positions in multiple categories \u2014 stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. \u2014 instead of using all their funds to only buy one stock. The general concept is that if the money is spread into different positions and one does poorly, the others will hopefully do better to balance the account out.\u201d You might hear an advisor ask you about your investment horizon or see this term come up in contexts like retirement planning. The good news is that it\u2019s a pretty simple term that typically aligns with certain investing practices. \u201cThe investment horizon refers to the period during which you expect to keep your money invested before needing to use it. It can be short-term (less than a year), such as a down payment or a car; medium-term (a few years), like college expenses for kids in five years; or long-term (10-20 years or more), like retirement,\u201d said Jon Knotts, chief investment officer at Expressive Wealth."

In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on HRMY. Harmony Biosciences Holdings, Inc. (HRMY)'s share was trading at $35.03 as of 5th June. HRMY\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 13.37 and 9.45 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. Copyright: zneb076 / 123RF Stock Photo Harmony Biosciences stands out as an overlooked gem in the small-cap biotech space, combining strong financials with pipeline potential in a niche therapeutic area. With a $2 billion market cap and a focus on rare neurological diseases, Harmony's flagship drug WAKIX for narcolepsy has underpinned impressive fundamentals\u201435% revenue CAGR since 2020, 25% net margins, and consistent free cash flow conversion above 30%. Despite these metrics, the stock trades at just 13x earnings and an EV/EBITDA of 7.9x, reflecting investor scepticism largely tied to single-product dependency and unresolved legal risks from 2023 fraud allegations. Still, Harmony boasts over $480 million in cash, negligible debt, and a stable share count, which enhances confidence in long-term shareholder returns. While WAKIX remains the core revenue driver, the company is aggressively diversifying through M&A, including the Zynerba and Epygenix acquisitions, bringing promising assets like ZYN002 for Fragile X Syndrome into the pipeline. Phase 3 data expected in Q3 2025 could catalyze upside, alongside the development of Pitolisant HD and other preclinical candidates. A DCF valuation incorporating conservative assumptions yields share prices between $38 and $62, implying a substantial upside from current levels. Analyst sentiment is bullish, with eight of nine recent ratings being buys and a $51 average price target. Although risks like competition from Jazz Pharmaceuticals, FDA hurdles, and prolonged legal overhang remain, Harmony\u2019s profitability, cash strength, and strategic execution offer investors a compelling asymmetrical opportunity. For those seeking exposure to a profitable, underappreciated rare disease player with both pipeline and financial momentum, Harmony merits close attention. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Harmony Biosciences by Long-Access-2143 in April 2025, which aligns with Taylor Nichols\u2019 analysis. The stock has seen an appreciation of approximately 13% since then. Both highlight WAKIX\u2019s strength and undervaluation, while Long-Access-2143 stresses the mispricing post short-seller attack and details a WAKIX-driven DCF, Nichols places more emphasis on pipeline expansion and cash strength. Together, they reinforce Harmony\u2019s appeal as a profitable, underappreciated biotech."

In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on IRS. IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad An\u00f3nima (IRS)'s share was trading at $ 14.63 as of 5th June. IRS\u2019s trailing P/E was 7.83 according to Yahoo Finance. Aerial view of a shopping mall bustling with consumers. Irsa presents a compelling opportunity as a deeply misunderstood Argentinian real estate operator trading well below the intrinsic value of its high-quality, cash-generating portfolio. At its core, Irsa owns and operates a diversified mix of shopping malls, office buildings, hotels, and development land, mostly in and around Buenos Aires. Following a five-year corporate simplification, including the 2021 merger with its subsidiary Irsa CP, management has focused on increasing operational efficiency, reducing its office footprint, and redirecting capital into core assets like retail. Irsa\u2019s 16 malls encompass 370,000 sqm of GLA, generating consistent tenant sales and achieving occupancy rates above 94%. Its dual rent model\u2014base rent plus a variable sales-linked fee\u2014allows income to scale as the economy improves. Despite Argentina\u2019s turmoil, mall gross margins have averaged 90%, with normalized operating margins of 70\u201375%, reflecting both asset quality and prudent management. Recent capital deployments affirm the company\u2019s reinvestment discipline. In August 2024, Irsa acquired a parcel adjacent to Alto Avellaneda for $12.2M, with the potential to add $3.47M in after-tax profit plus $1.15M in non-rental income. In December, Irsa announced the acquisition of Terrazas de Mayo, a mall with 33,720 sqm of GLA and an estimated 7 million annual visitors, adding further depth to its portfolio. The company\u2019s selective expansion strategy has historically yielded durable returns, underpinned by long asset lives and prime locations. Meanwhile, Irsa has actively reduced its office footprint from 115,000 to 59,000 sqm since 2018, monetizing non-core holdings while adding premium inventory like the Della Paollera tower. Its hotel segment, with three long-held properties, rebounded strongly in FY24 with $45M in revenue and a 29% operating margin, supported by resilient domestic and affluent tourist demand. Irsa\u2019s resilience through multiple recessions and the pandemic stems from its disciplined asset management and high-margin structure. Yet, the market often overlooks this due to Argentina\u2019s macro instability and the noise in Irsa\u2019s income statements from frequent asset revaluations."

In particular, a repo agent \u2014 also known as a repossession agent, who is employed by a collection agency to repossess property over a failure to make contractual payments \u2014 has been \u201ccoming at me hard.\u201d Jordan said he has also gone into collections with some household bills. The repo man wants either $5,000 down with smaller monthly payments or a monthly payment of about $800 a month for a year and a half. \u201cI\u2019m the sole provider of a family of four and so that kind of makes it difficult,\u201d Jordan told Dave Ramsey during the episode. Jordan makes about $92,000 a year working in construction. He got behind with his payments when he switched jobs, but ultimately said, \u201cI can make excuses all day but really just being irresponsible with my money.\u201d Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 \u2014 and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

Instead, he advises him to start by making a list of everything in his budget. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get extremely detailed, extremely organized,\u201d Ramsey said.

Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (RKLB)'s share was trading at $26.45 as of 5th June. A closeup of a spacecraft in launch position, ready for takeoff. Rocket Lab (RKLB) delivered a strong Q1 2025, generating $122.6 million in revenue\u2014a 32.1% year-over-year increase\u2014fuelled by five Electron launches and continued momentum in its Space Systems business. Though revenue dipped sequentially due to lower average selling prices (ASP) for launches and production timing, CFO Adam Spice expressed confidence in higher ASPs and gross margin expansion through 2025. Electron has firmly established dominance in the U.S. small launch market, accounting for 63 launches since 2015\u2014more than triple all competitors combined. The company\u2019s HASTE program also gained traction, securing contracts under the $46 billion EWAAC initiative and seven Department of Defence MACH-TB missions. Central to Rocket Lab\u2019s long-term vision is its vertically integrated approach, which strengthens resilience and positions it as an end-to-end space company. This strategy is reflected in the development of its reusable medium-lift rocket, Neutron, which recently secured a pivotal role in the U.S. Space Force\u2019s $5.6 billion NSSL Phase 3 program, making Rocket Lab the only publicly traded company ever onboarded. With the first Neutron launch targeted for late 2025, key milestones\u2014such as stage qualification, assembly progress, and engine testing\u2014are already in motion. Financially, Rocket Lab is nearing free cash flow positivity, excluding Neutron costs, with Electron on track for 24 annual launches and 50% gross margins. Backed by $517 million in liquidity and a robust mission backlog, Rocket Lab is also pursuing M&A to further strengthen its supply chain and capabilities, exemplified by the pending Mynaric acquisition. Even without Neutron, Electron and Space Systems alone could soon support profitability, limiting downside and amplifying upside potential. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Rocket Lab (RKLB) by Steve Wagner, which aligns with Lorenzo Bastianelli\u2019s. The stock has since seen an appreciation of approximately 28%. Wagner focuses on the expanding $1.07 billion backlog, Space Systems\u2019 dominant 71% revenue contribution, and the upcoming Neutron rocket as a long-term growth driver. Taken together, the theses paint a picture of a maturing space infrastructure company, with Neutron providing upside optionality and Electron and Space Systems forming a strong, increasingly profitable base."

(NYSE:BKH) is an electric and natural gas utility company in the U.S. The 52-week range of Black Hills stock price was $51.66 to $65.59. Black Hills' dividend yield is 4.71%. It paid $2.70 per share in dividends during the last 12 months.

Invest Where It Hurts \u2014 And Help Millions Heal: Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold. On May 7, the company announced its Q1 2025 earnings, posting EPS of $1.87, coming in below the consensus estimate of $1.93, while revenues of $805.20 million beat the consensus of $706.08 million, as reported by Benzinga. \"Looking ahead, our core utility rate base growth and earnings from our growing data center demand provides strong confidence in our 4% to 6% long-term EPS growth target. By the end of our five-year plan, we expect to serve 500 megawatts of data center demand from existing customers through our innovative business model that requires minimal capital, doubling earnings contribution to more than 10% in 2028,\" said CEO Linn Evans. The company reaffirmed its guidance for full-year 2025, expecting EPS in the range of $4 to $4.20. Trending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here\u2019s how you can earn passive income with just $100. If you want to make $100 per month \u2014 $1,200 annually \u2014 from Black Hills dividends, your investment value needs to be approximately $25,478, which is around 443 shares at $57.45 each. Understanding the dividend yield calculations: When making an estimate, you need two key variables \u2014 the desired annual income ($1,200) and the dividend yield (4.71% in this case). So, $1,200 / 0.0471 = $25,478 to generate an income of $100 per month. You can calculate the dividend yield by dividing the annual dividend payments by the current price of the stock. The dividend yield can change over time. This is the outcome of fluctuating stock prices and dividend payments on a rolling basis. See Also: Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes: Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey \u2013 no cost, no obligation.  For instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2/$50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40)."

    "text": "We came across a bullish thesis on Primerica, Inc. (PRI) on Value Investing subreddit by PortlandCatLover. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on PRI. Primerica, Inc. (PRI)'s share was trading at $265.13 as of 5th June. PRI\u2019s trailing P/E was 12.16 according to Yahoo Finance. A senior financial advisor shaking hands with a client next to a wall case displaying certificates of successfully completed financial services. Primerica stands out as a quietly compounding financial powerhouse with roots in middle America and a unique distribution edge. Often compared to Edward Jones, but with a stronger emphasis on selling insurance and investments through community-focused channels like churches, the company benefits from deep client loyalty and a mission-driven workforce. This grassroots approach has translated into a decade of consistent and impressive financial performance. Primerica\u2019s free cash flow per share has compounded at an 18.2% rate over the past ten years, reflecting both operational strength and capital discipline. Its free cash flow margins have steadily improved from 18.1% in 2015 to 26.4% in 2024, while ROIC has climbed from a modest 2.4% to 5.9%, showing growing efficiency in deploying capital. Despite a temporary dip in 2023, 2024 saw a sharp rebound with 33% free cash flow per share growth, underlining resilience. The company\u2019s current free cash flow yield of 9.2% is in line with historical averages but remains compelling in absolute terms, especially given the low leverage and fundamental strength of the business. Primerica has also delivered a stellar 10-year total return CAGR of 21.08%, with a 19.17% gain over the past year, underscoring continued investor confidence. While the stock currently trades below its 52-week high, the improving fundamentals and consistent cash generation suggest latent upside. For long-term investors, Primerica offers a rare combination of grassroots brand loyalty, operational discipline, and capital efficiency, making it a potential compounder still flying under the radar. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Primerica (PRI) by Max Dividends in February 2025, which aligns with PortlandCatLover\u2019s analysis on the Value Investing subreddit highlighting consistent free cash flow growth and capital discipline. Both emphasize Primerica\u2019s shareholder-friendly capital return policies, expanding margins, and mission-driven salesforce targeting middle-income America. Max Dividends focuses on institutional ownership, digital investments, and dividend growth as signs of enduring strength. The stock has depreciated by 4.2% since then; however, as mentioned above, the improving fundamentals and consistent cash generation suggest latent upside."

Eli Lilly and Company (LLY)'s share was trading at $765.68 as of 5th June. LLY\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 62.30 and 35.09 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A picture of a pharma technician preparing an IV injection of a biopharmaceutical product. Eli Lilly is no longer just a pharmaceutical giant\u2014it\u2019s becoming a platform company that\u2019s reshaping the very structure of global healthcare. At the heart of this transformation is tirzepatide, a dual-action molecule marketed under separate brands for diabetes and obesity. This single drug now accounts for over a quarter of Lilly\u2019s total revenue, with the diabetes version generating $11.5 billion (up 330% YoY) and the obesity variant reaching $2.3 billion in its first year\u2014a historic ramp-up. These are not just growth numbers; they\u2019re margin-rich results, with 85 %+ gross margins and minimal marketing spend due to entrenched trust among endocrinologists. Crucially, tirzepatide is protected by a fortress of patents through 2036 and beyond, giving Lilly a durable edge in two massive markets. Unlike peers, Lilly owns its injectable manufacturing end-to-end, having invested over $5.5 billion in internal capacity, giving it unmatched agility and control while rivals struggle with supply constraints. Its sales force and deep prescriber relationships, built over decades, have only grown more powerful thanks to a new direct-to-consumer platform that streamlines initiation and adherence. Meanwhile, the company is reinvesting aggressively, with $11 billion (24% of revenue) spent on focused R&D spanning Alzheimer\u2019s, oncology, and rare diseases. Its pipeline\u2014anchored in metabolic, neurodegenerative, and immune disorders\u2014builds on existing strengths, accelerating commercialization. Competition exists, but Lilly\u2019s molecule consistently outperforms, and its infrastructure outscales. With two-thirds of sales still U.S.-based, global expansion represents the next lever. In sum, Lilly\u2019s model\u2014a convergence of science, scale, and system\u2014positions it as more than a pharma company. It\u2019s a precision biology platform with extraordinary strategic depth and long-term compounding potential. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Eli Lilly (LLY) by Kontra on Substack in May 2025, which aligns with Business Model Mastery\u2019s analysis, emphasizing the company\u2019s leadership in obesity and diabetes care. Both highlight tirzepatide\u2019s explosive growth, margin strength, and Lilly\u2019s massive investment in capacity and R&D. Kontra focuses more on near-term financial results, pipeline expansion, and regulatory catalysts, while Business Model Mastery frames Lilly as a precision biology platform with structural advantages\u2014like end-to-end manufacturing and patent longevity\u2014that support durable outperformance. Together, they reinforce Lilly\u2019s status as a long-term compounder with deep moats and global runway."

Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients but also with the global investment community. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.

    "text": "We came across a bullish thesis on Crocs, Inc. (CROX) on The Finance Corner\u2019s Substack by Kostadin Ristovski. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on CROX. Crocs, Inc. (CROX)'s share was trading at $100.17 as of 5th June. CROX\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 6.18 and 8.61 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. andersphoto / Shutterstock.com Crocs, founded in 2002, has carved out a unique space in the footwear industry with its polarizing design and proprietary Croslite material, offering comfort, lightness, and odor resistance. While its classic clogs and sandals are not inherently exciting, the company has driven engagement through personalization, celebrity partnerships, and Jibbitz accessories\u2014turning its products into cult items especially among Gen Z. The brand saw an unexpected surge during the pandemic, as demand for comfortable, at-home footwear soared, propelling revenue and pushing its stock price from $11 to $180 in just over a year. Recognizing the temporary nature of this boom, management sought to diversify with the acquisition of HEYDUDE for $2.5 billion\u2014a move initially criticized by the market. While HEYDUDE added lightweight, casual loafers to the portfolio and aimed for $1B in revenue by 2024, it fell short at $824M, validating some investor scepticism. However, CEO Andrew Rees has demonstrated strategic discipline, notably through an earlier rationalization that saw a 40% reduction in Crocs stores. Today, the company generates ~$900M in annual free cash flow, focusing on deleveraging and aggressive share buybacks, having reduced shares outstanding by 7% in 2024 alone. Still, questions persist: Is Crocs a lasting brand or a fashion fad? Bear, base, and bull valuation cases suggest fair values between $76 and $143 per share, hinging on this very question. Encouragingly, international markets grew 42% over two years while North America stagnated, and global manufacturing diversification gives Crocs strategic flexibility. At a $5.5B market cap, the company offers attractive upside\u2014if it avoids missteps and remains culturally relevant. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Crocs (CROX) by Taylor Nichols, which aligns with Kostadin Ristovski\u2019s take. Since then, the stock has seen an 11% appreciation in price. Both highlight strong cash flow, high margins, and smart capital allocation. Nichols emphasizes valuation upside and financial strength, while Ristovski focuses on brand relevance and international growth. Together, they make a compelling bull case from both quantitative and qualitative angles."

The partnership aims to extend the firm\u2019s geographic reach, strengthen its digital infrastructure, and support selective acquisitions as it evolves into a larger, multi-regional advisory platform.

    "text": "We came across a bullish thesis on Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. (FND) on Summit Stock\u2019s Substack. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on FND. Floor & Decor Holdings, Inc. (FND)'s share was trading at $ 72.50 as of 5th June. FND\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 38.36 and 39.06 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A customer browsing a variety of residential furniture and accessories in a retail store. Floor & Decor (FND), a specialty retailer with over 250 warehouse-format stores focused exclusively on hard-surface flooring, has carved out a strong position in a fragmented industry by offering the widest in-stock selection at everyday low prices. While the broader housing slowdown has dampened growth and pressured its stock, FND is far from a struggling retailer. Underneath the surface lies a business with outstanding unit economics, a durable competitive moat, and a clear path for long-term expansion. Drawing comparisons to Costco, which it mimics through scale-driven efficiencies and aggressive pricing, FND has built a defensible niche that even giants like Home Depot struggle to replicate. Since 2011, it has grown revenue from $300 million to $4.5 billion in 2024, compounding at an impressive 24% annually. Much of this success stems from its disciplined warehouse-store model, narrow product focus, and operational excellence, which together provide cost and logistical advantages that translate into pricing power and customer loyalty. Although growth has decelerated since 2022 due to elevated mortgage rates and softer housing turnover, the underlying story remains compelling. The company is continuing to expand store count through the downturn, which temporarily pressures financial optics but signals management\u2019s confidence in the long-term opportunity. Importantly, this strategic expansion during cyclical weakness could set the stage for an even stronger rebound when housing activity normalizes. For investors willing to look past near-term headwinds, Floor & Decor represents a high-quality, resilient compounder with a wide moat, significant market share potential, and the discipline to execute over the long term. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Costco (COST) by FluentInQuality on Substack in March 2025, which aligns thematically with Summit Stock\u2019s bullish take on Floor & Decor (FND). Both highlight scale-driven efficiencies, low-cost operating models, and customer loyalty as core advantages. However, Costco leans on recurring membership income and diversified bulk retail, while FND focuses on a niche product category with pricing power through deep inventory and operational focus. Together, they showcase how warehouse-style retail can compound value across different segments when executed with discipline."

Hims & Hers Health, Inc. (HIMS)'s share was trading at $52.77 as of 5th June. HIMS\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 77.60 and 86.96 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. A doctor interacting with a patient, discussing the progress of their treatment. Hims & Hers delivered an extraordinary Q1 2025, with revenue soaring 111% YoY to $586M \u2014 the company\u2019s fastest top-line growth ever, powered largely by explosive demand for compounded GLP-1s. Though management expects this contribution to taper as commercial semaglutide becomes widely available, full-year revenue is still projected to grow over 60%, underpinned by the company\u2019s expanding portfolio and subscriber base. While non-GLP-1 revenue growth slowed to ~30%, this was largely due to a strategic shift in marketing spend toward weight loss, which is now being reversed. Subscriber count rose 38% to 2.37M, and average monthly revenue per user surged 53% YoY, reinforcing strong unit economics. Although Q2 guidance disappointed and gross margins contracted to 73% due to product mix, management expects margin recovery as semaglutide supply stabilizes. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $91M, and FCF hit $50M despite increased capex \u2014 all signs of strong operational leverage and disciplined capital allocation. To sustain momentum and support its ambitious 2030 targets of $6.5B in revenue and $1.3B in EBITDA, HIMS is focused on five key growth levers. First, it\u2019s deepening personalization, which now touches over 60% of subscribers and has meaningfully boosted retention across legacy and newer categories like dermatology, weight loss, and sexual health. Second, it\u2019s expanding into high-impact specialties like hormone therapy, longevity, and early cancer detection, backed by diagnostic acquisitions and a new peptide manufacturing facility aimed at democratizing cutting-edge treatments. Third, HIMS is enhancing platform capabilities through proprietary data and AI tools like MedMatch are making care more intelligent, adaptive, and engaging. Fourth, the company is partnering selectively with blue-chip pharma, most notably Novo Nordisk, to gain clinical credibility and expand access to branded medications. Though regulatory overhang persists, these alliances reduce risk and solidify HIMS as a trusted distribution partner. Lastly, the company is scaling internationally, with early success in the UK validating its model abroad. While insurance partnerships remain off the table by design, the platform\u2019s low-friction, consumer-first approach offers flexibility as it targets other English-speaking markets."

In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on LMND. Lemonade, Inc. (LMND)'s share was trading at $35.76 as of 5th June. A close-up of a family receiving life insurance coverage documents. Lemonade has demonstrated remarkable scalability, growing its in-force premium by 65% since 2022 while keeping operating expenses flat, which signals both efficient capital deployment and a robust engineering culture. Its AI-driven infrastructure enables it to operate with significant leverage, but the central question remains whether this AI also allows Lemonade to price insurance risk more accurately than traditional players. Although visibility on this front is limited, management's execution over the past few years suggests promising odds of solving the risk-pricing puzzle. Currently, Lemonade\u2019s unit economics remain negative, as reflected in its free cash flow per share, though the trajectory is improving. The company\u2019s strategy hinges on scaling first, subsidizing customers to build a proprietary dataset rich enough to power its AI models, rather than attempting to acquire an external, multidimensional dataset like Meta\u2019s social graph. This approach is more feasible and aligns with management\u2019s long-held goal of reaching EBITDA breakeven by 2026. CEO Dan Schreiber\u2019s comments in the Q1 2025 earnings call highlighted Lemonade\u2019s real-time, AI-powered underwriting capabilities, which allow granular, customer-level investment decisions that no other insurer appears to match. While lacking a dense social graph makes Lemonade vulnerable to future disruption from data-rich platforms, its steadily declining gross loss ratio, down to 59% excluding the California wildfires, indicates rapidly improving underwriting precision. If this trend holds, Lemonade could evolve into a winner-takes-all player in AI-native insurance. Still, negative cash flow introduces risk, and although the price-to-sales ratio has doubled over the past year to 4. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on Lemonade (LMND) by Steve Wagner, which aligns with Antonio Linares\u2019 June 2025 analysis, emphasizing scalability and AI-native infrastructure. The stock has since seen an appreciation of approximately 15%. Both highlight Lemonade\u2019s improving loss ratios, disciplined cost control, and trajectory toward breakeven. However, Wagner leans on near-term financial execution and intrinsic valuation upside, while Linares frames Lemonade as a long-term AI data flywheel, focusing more on structural competitive advantages. Together, they reinforce confidence in Lemonade\u2019s upside, though with differing emphasis on timeline and tech differentiation."

In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on CRWV. CoreWeave, Inc. (CRWV)'s share was trading at $ 135.05 as of 5th June. A scientist at a computer station, surrounded by a neural network of artificial intelligence code. CoreWeave\u2019s IPO has become one of the most closely watched in recent memory, offering a rare inside look into the infrastructure powering today\u2019s AI revolution. Originally founded as The Atlantic Crypto Corporation in 2017, the company pivoted from crypto mining to GPU-based cloud computing in 2022, just as demand for accelerated AI workloads began to explode. This well-timed shift has fueled explosive growth, with revenue soaring from $20 million in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. CoreWeave now operates 32 data centers with over 250,000 Nvidia GPUs and more than 360 MW of active power, enabling it to serve top-tier clients such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Cohere, and Mistral. Its vertically integrated, Kubernetes-native platform is purpose-built for AI and delivers significantly higher performance, including up to 20% better Model FLOPS Utilization than legacy hyperscalers. Deeply tied to Nvidia\u2014its largest partner and shareholder with a 5% stake\u2014CoreWeave is often first to bring new GPU architectures like the H200 and GB200 NVL72 to market. While this relationship gives CoreWeave a competitive edge, it also presents concentration risks, as all current customer contracts mandate Nvidia hardware. Its business model centers on long-term, take-or-pay contracts averaging four years in duration, with 96% of 2024 revenue underpinned by these commitments. Customers prepay before CoreWeave installs capacity, derisking its growth. Now publicly listed, CoreWeave represents a compelling lens into the evolving AI infrastructure stack, combining purpose-built architecture, strategic alignment with Nvidia, and financial predictability, making it a cornerstone player in the AI economy. While CrowdStrike (CRWD) faces scrutiny over its elevated valuation and operational headwinds, CoreWeave (CRWV) offers a contrasting AI infrastructure bet rooted in explosive growth and Nvidia alignment. Both are central to the AI narrative\u2014CRWD on the security front and CRWV on the compute backbone\u2014but CoreWeave\u2019s take-or-pay contracts and visibility into future revenues provide a level of financial derisking not currently seen in CRWD\u2019s high-multiple, sentiment-sensitive profile. Previously, we covered a bearish thesis on CrowdStrike (CRWD) by Stock Whisperer on Substack in May 2025, pointing to bearish technicals, workforce reductions, and sentiment risk. While both highlight valuation concerns, Stock Whisperer adds near-term catalysts for caution, framing CRWD as vulnerable despite its long-term strength. Viewed together, CRWD and CRWV offer a study in contrasting AI exposure\u2014mature cybersecurity versus hyper-growth infra."

Sustainable Impact Investing is gaining traction not only with Argus Research clients but also with the global investment community. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead. Nvidia Corp., based in Santa Clara, California, is a visual computing company with worldwide operations and markets. The company operates through two segments, Graphics and Compute & Networking. The company's four main markets are Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. In calendar 2020, Nvidia completed the acquisition of data-center connectivity leader Mellanox. Cutting Forecasts in an Unsettled Environment We are adjusting our estimates of S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations for calendar 2025 and 2026 to reflect potential negative impacts on earnings from higher costs and reduced commerce. Normally, we would adjust our EPS forecasts once or perhaps twice over the course of a year. We are not sure what will happen with tariffs and White House policy, but we may need to adjust our forecasts a few more times over the remainder of 2025. For now, our EPS reductions are tweaks rather than big moves. On the upside, the first-quarter earnings season modestly outperformed our expectations, with annual EPS growth of about 14%; we had been modeling high-single-digit to low-double-digit EPS growth. On the downside, where steep tariffs are scheduled and then paused or pushed out, companies are still struggling to finalize 2025 capital budgets. Major corporations have proposed a range of strategies to deal with tariffs. At either end of the spectrum, Walmart says it will pass along tariffs to its customers; and Home Depot says it will absorb the cost of tariffs. The Walmart strategy, as the company has acknowledged, could result in lost revenue as customers (particularly in the lower tiers of the economy) forego planned purchases and make do with less. The Home Depot strategy, in theory, should do a better job of protecting the revenue stream -- but inevitably will cut into margins and thus earnings. We believe most companies will strike a balance somewhere in the middle, passing along some portion and absorbing some portion of tariffs. The 'mix' of pass along and absorb likely will vary from company to company, based on a range of factors. These could include where a company sources raw materials, which regional markets are served, and which products and components are partially or fully exempt from tariffs. 2025 EPS: After a Strong 1Q, Softer in the Middle First-quarter 2025 earnings season took place amid a major shift in U.S. trade policy that drove a turbulent response in asset markets. The U.S. ended the Biden presidency era with much of the tariff architecture intact from President Trump's first term. On April 2, days before the large money center banks began the reporting season, the president unleashed his schedule of 'Liberation Day' tariffs across dozens of nations. Although the high tariff rates were proposals meant to act as negotiating tools, they sent the stock market crashing. The president's criticism of Fed Chair Jay Powell slammed the bond market and the U.S. dollar, further contributing to unease. Subsequently, certain key tariff shifts (on China, the UK, etc.) and a more conciliatory tone toward the Fed allowed the stock market to surge back to year-opening levels. Amid this turbulence, the only 'normal' thing was 1Q25 earnings season. As is common, earnings exceeded expectations; these expectations were uncommonly gloomy as the trade environment worsened. As the quarter progressed, the blended EPS growth estimates from FactSet, Refinitiv, and Bloomberg all ticked 500 to 600 basis points higher than they were at the beginning of the earnings season, as upside surprises displaced conservative estimates in the blended tally. The three EPS compiling agencies all calculated final 1Q25 EPS growth in the 13%-14% range. About 75% of companies surpassed Street expectations; early in the reporting season, that percentage was closer to 70%. On a long-term basis (past 10 years), about three-quarters of companies reporting EPS growth have surprised to the upside. Additionally, the magnitude of the EPS beat jumped meaningfully higher as the quarter progressed, to around 9%. That is better than the 7% long-term average and now also in line with the 9% intermediate-term average. First-quarter earnings growth and revenue growth were perceived as having benefited from some 'front-loading' by businesses as a way to acquire raw materials and goods inventories ahead of anticipated tariffs. We also think some consumers may have accelerated purchases of goods, particularly those made in China, with an eye to potential price hikes in coming months. We think this pulling-forward of business and consumer activity into 1Q25, along with foregone sales at companies passing along tariffs and margin hits at companies absorbing tariffs, will be felt in second-quarter earnings and to a lesser extent in third-quarter earnings. We look for a return to stronger EPS growth in 2026, assuming tariff stability, but not as strong as we had earlier modeled. Revisions to 2025 and 2026 EPS Estimates Until the final tariff schedule is established -- not just in the U.S. but among our trading partners as well -- there will be a fair amount of speculation in any single EPS estimate, much less all the estimates for the hundreds of companies in the S&P 500. Also worth keeping in mind is that tariffs are far from the only driver of revenue and earnings growth. For 2025, our forecast for S&P 500 earnings from continuing operations is $270, reduced from $276. For 2026, our new estimate is $300, reduced from $307. Our new 2025 EPS estimate implies full-year EPS growth of 10%, reduced from 12%. And our new 2026 estimate assumes EPS growth of 10%, reduced from 11%. For the middle quarters of 2025, we are using more-conservative growth assumptions for most sectors. In particular, we have reduced our 2025 growth assumptions for Consumer Discretionary, Healthcare, Industrial, and Information Technology. Consumer Discretionary faces the triple whammy of already-high goods inflation, the potential for further price hikes due to tariffs, and financing rates for large-ticket items that remain too high. We still look for Healthcare EPS to grow in double-digit percentages, but have cut our growth forecast nearly in half due to the potential for White House-mandated lower drug prices and pressure on insurance company earnings from elevated procedure volumes (hips, knees, etc.). Industrial earnings could be impacted by reduced foreign demand for big-ticket equipment from machine tools to excavators to commercial aircraft. Information Technology, the largest sector, faces an appropriately large basket of risks. These include on-again, off-again tariffs on smartphones, PCs, and semiconductors, and an ever-shifting web of regulation on what technology can and cannot be shipped to China. Conclusion Our 2025 EPS growth forecast is bookended by low-double-digit growth in 1Q25 and 4Q25, with mid-single-digit growth in the middle quarters of the year. We then look for more-stable but partly-subdued growth across 2026. Accordingly, our EPS growth estimates are 10% for both 2025 and 2026. Bloomberg, which compiles analyst estimates from hundreds of companies, is now forecasting that 2025 EPS growth will slip to 7.4% in 2025 before bouncing back to 13.1% in 2026. The net effect is that the Argus and Bloomberg 2026 EPS estimates are identical at a rounded $300. In offering a 'smoothed' earnings forecast, Argus is taking into account the fact that corporate America, which may seem like a set of large faceless entities, actually fights for EPS growth at a very granular level. Nearly every major company will feature several major divisions. Each division will have segments that have sub-segments, burrowing down to a final mid-level manager overseeing a dozen or so employees. In each of these tiny pieces of the whole, the manager and team are using everything they have at their disposal to find efficiencies, negotiate hard with vendors and customers, and find new incentives to drive business activity. The unheralded work of these teams, rather than the polish of the C-Suite, is why S&P 500 companies consistently beat EPS expectations by 5%-8%. In the tariff wars, new workarounds are emerging, while familiar ones are being exploited. Under the First Sale rule, the tariff is assessed on the first transaction related to finished good. With some creative freight handling, this can reduce a tariff substantially. If the White House decides to play whack-a-mole with the First Sale rule, as it did with the de minimus exemption, other workarounds are likely to pop up. The stock market is back to approximately year-opening levels, while the earnings outlook is somewhat weaker. The economic outlook remains clouded by tariffs and trade wars. In this uncertain environment, we would continue to focus on companies with strong management, blue chip finances, clear competitive advantage, and the ability to create and monetize a steady stream of new, in-demand products."

Since April 21 (or since the secondary market low and eight days after \"the\" closing low of the correction in the major indices), stocks have enjoyed a massive and consistent tailwind. The S&P 500 (SPX) has risen in 16 out of 19 trade days, and the three daily losses were inconsequential. Since the April 8 bottom, the SPX has soared 19.6% in 27 days, the Nasdaq has surged 26%, and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) has popped 25%. That performance is the best since, and very reminiscent of, the pandemic.
